A basic node development VM managed by Vagrant, for rapid refreshes while learning node. Uses nvm. Nothing else included right now.

The goal is a simple, "push-button" node development environment that can be customized as needed. Might add some packages later.

Getting this together was tricky since I'm only occasionally a Linux user, requiring reading a great many articles (most of which
were outdated) and many many `vagrant up` rounds to get it right. So maybe this will give someone else a head start if they want 
to start learning node quickly.

Note: Only tested on Windows 10 with Vagrant 1.8.6 driving VirtualBox 5.0.24, but it should run anywhere Vagrant can run.
